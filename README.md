# E-commerce Sales Analysis using Oracle SQL

## Overview

This project is an **E-commerce Sales Analysis** system built using Oracle SQL. It is designed to analyze sales data from an e-commerce platform, providing insights into total sales, sales by product, category, and customer, as well as daily sales trends. The system is constructed using SQL tables to manage products, customers, and sales transactions, and it employs SQL queries to generate detailed reports and analyses.

## Features

- **Product Management**: A table to manage the details of products including category and pricing.
- **Customer Management**: A table for managing customer information such as names, email addresses, and join dates.
- **Sales Transactions**: A table to record sales transactions, including product, customer, quantity, and sales date.
- **Sales Analysis**: SQL queries to analyze total sales, sales by product, category, and customer, and to track sales trends over time.

## Technologies Used

- **Oracle SQL**: The core database technology used to create tables, manage data, and execute complex queries for sales analysis.
- **SQL Concepts**:
  - **Joins**: Used to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns, essential for generating reports.
  - **Aggregate Functions**: Such as `SUM`, used to calculate total sales and other aggregated data.
  - **Group By**: Used to group data by specific columns like product name, category, or customer name for detailed analysis.
  - **Subqueries**: Used to calculate fields like `total_amount` directly during data insertion.

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Setting Up the Database

1. **Connect to Oracle SQL**:
   - Use SQL*Plus or any other Oracle SQL command-line tool.
   - Connect as `SYS AS SYSDBA` using the following command:
     ```sql
     CONN SYS AS SYSDBA;
     ```
   - Enter the password: `system`.

2. **Run the SQL Script**:
   - Execute the SQL script file `ecommerce_sales_analysis.sql` to create the necessary tables and populate them with initial data.

### 2. Running the Sales Analysis

Once the database is set up, you can run the provided SQL queries to perform various sales analyses:

1. **Total Sales Amount**:
   - Calculate the total revenue generated from all sales transactions.

2. **Total Sales by Product**:
   - Aggregate the total sales revenue for each product.

3. **Total Sales by Category**:
   - Aggregate the total sales revenue for each product category.

4. **Total Sales by Customer**:
   - Aggregate the total sales revenue generated by each customer.

5. **Sales Over Time (Daily Sales)**:
   - Track daily sales totals to understand sales trends over time.

### 3. Expanding the System

- **Add More Data**: Expand the dataset by adding more products, customers, and sales transactions to simulate a more complex e-commerce environment.
- **Refine Queries**: Adjust the queries to include additional metrics or to focus on specific time periods, products, or customer segments.
- **Integrate with Applications**: The SQL-based system can be integrated with frontend applications or reporting tools for real-time sales analysis and dashboarding.

## Concepts Used

- **Relational Database Management**: Understanding and implementing the core concepts of relational databases including tables, primary keys, foreign keys, and relationships.
- **Data Analysis**: Leveraging SQL to perform data analysis and extract meaningful insights from sales data.
- **Reporting and Analytics**: Using SQL queries to generate reports and analyze key performance metrics in an e-commerce environment.
